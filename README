Server-side scripts for Slate.com's Gun Deaths project.

This package includes:
- Scripts for registering new users and logging them in. Registered users include some Slate.com editors and volunteers whom Slate editors have vetted. These users can access a GUI that allows them to easily manipulate the victims database.
- The documents related to that GUI, located in the "form" directory.
- Scripts for adding, removing, and modifying victim data. These scripts are executable only by users who are logged in.
- A script for retrieiving victim data based on a URL query string from the database.
- Documents related to an effort by Slate.com to crowdsource the classifications of each death (accident, murder, self-defense, etc.), in "categorization"
